<h1>Optimal Strategy for Minimum Cost from City1 to City2</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the repository for the <strong>Optimal Strategy for Minimum Cost from City1 to City2</strong> project. This application aims to find the most cost-effective route for traveling from a starting city to a destination city using Dynamic Programming techniques. The problem involves calculating the minimum cost path considering various travel distances, petrol costs, and hotel costs, and it requires the implementation of a solution that efficiently handles and processes the input data.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Input Data Handling:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Read Input Data:</strong> Load data from a file that includes the number of cities, start and end cities, adjacent cities with distances and costs, and additional information about petrol and hotel costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Programming Calculation:</strong> Implement a DP algorithm to compute the minimum cost path from the start city to the end city considering various stopovers and choices of hotels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output Results:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal Path and Cost:</strong> Display the most cost-effective route and the total cost for traveling from city1 to city2.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative Solutions:</strong> Provide additional feasible routes and their costs for comparison.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Programming Table:</strong> Show the DP table used to calculate the minimum cost and path.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Implement a user-friendly interface using JavaFX to interact with the application, including options to load files, view results, and navigate through functionalities.</li>
    <li><strong>File Handling:</strong> Use a file chooser to select and save files, ensuring the application can read and write data in the required format.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Core Functionalities</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Path Calculation:</strong> Calculate the minimum cost path using dynamic programming, considering all possible routes and costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Results Presentation:</strong> Display the optimal path, its cost, and alternative solutions in a clear and organized manner.</li>
    <li><strong>GUI Interaction:</strong> Allow users to load input data, view results, and save updated data through an intuitive graphical interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Stack</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Dynamic Programming for solving the minimum cost path problem.</li>
    <li><strong>File Handling:</strong> Read and parse data from text files to extract necessary information.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong> Use linked lists and other appropriate data structures to manage and compute data efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>GUI Framework:</strong> JavaFX for creating a responsive and user-friendly graphical interface.</li>
</ul>
